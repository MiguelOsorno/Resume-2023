                        Hello I'm a fullstack developer, I have been a developer for more than 5 years ðŸ¤“.
                        I have worked with companies that are very different each other, for instance, 
                        I have worked with a consultory and I was in charge of developing some websites. 
                        After that I was working with a company about social network and I learned many things about this sector that is very interesting.
                        I was working with people that are creating a new espresso machine that will allows making coffee in ways never seen before.
                        Now I am working in real estate intelligence platform.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-4">I'm always learning new things to improve my skills ðŸ““.
                        <br/>I like playing video games with my friends, listen to music in my free time ðŸŽ® ðŸŽ¶ and play the guitar ðŸŽ¸.
